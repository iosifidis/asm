# Animal Shelter Manager Live CD

Welcome to Animal Shelter Manager livecd!

Animal Shelter Manager is a program that keeps track of the animals in a shelter and can publish them to websites. Pet lovers can visit those websites and adopt a pet. This way we eliminate pets without owners in the best way.
